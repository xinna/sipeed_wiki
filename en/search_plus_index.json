Although the shape and Pin are compatible with Arduino UNO R3, the voltage level is not compatible, which requires great attention, otherwise the board may be damaged! Maixduino supports 3.3V and 1.8V levels, and the pins are divided into several BANK, each BANK can be set to a voltage of 1.8V or 3.3V by software, However, these pins are not `5V' tolerated. Therefore, when using the peripheral device of Arduino, be careful not to short the 5V to the pin or RST (1.8V) pin, otherwise the board may be damaged! For example, this Base Shield V2 expansion board: As can be seen from the design above, since the shield board is designed to be compatible with 5V and 3.3V designs, must not turn the switch to 5V, otherwise the board will be damaged! For this shield board, if you must prevent this problem from occurring, in view of the above circuit diagram, you can reduce the RST pin of the adapter board or solder off the resistor R2. Of course, this only prevents board damaged when the shield connected to nothing!
